## üß† About Me

I‚Äôm a versatile engineer with strong expertise in both backend development and data engineering. I build scalable backend services and robust data pipelines that reliably process, transform, and deliver data to power business applications.

Comfortable working across the full data lifecycle, I develop APIs, serverless functions, and automation to support data-driven workflows. My backend work primarily involves FastAPI, with solid experience in Spring Boot as well.

While expanding my skills in machine learning, my core focus remains on creating maintainable infrastructure and backend systems that enable efficient data operations and business insights.
